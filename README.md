Tidy Dataset depending on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"

==================================================================
This is a tidy dataset depending on 
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" 
from Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universit?degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers.
Each person performed six activities(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'
- 'mergedData.txt': consist of all the data from train and test dataset.
- 'selectedData.txt':containing only mean and standard deviation for each measurement with activity and subject labeled.
- 'understandData.txt': depending on selectedData, activity labels are replaced by decriptive activity names.
- 'secondData.txt': a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in selectedData.
